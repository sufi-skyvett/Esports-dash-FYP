# Esports-dash
This is a Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) management system for Esports event primarily built with HTML, CSS, and PHP. This is a test project I do for my Final Year Project, Bachelor of Computer Science with Honour ( Software Engineering ). Project source code + documentation is here.

I'm trying to modify it to be more polished and having better functionality.
